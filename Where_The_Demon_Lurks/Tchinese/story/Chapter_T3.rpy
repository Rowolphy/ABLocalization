In the show, the monkey god had a golden headband put on him, when the monk would read out a prayer the band would tighten around the monkey god, punishing him for his misbehaviours! Apparently the show is based on a real life myth! I hope it’s just that, a myth. I don’t want to meet no monkey god, who knows what trouble that can lead to.

Generally, low level demons aren’t allowed on Earth outside of company business... The Demon Lord can send out demons as Freelancers, but must fill the necessary documents in triplicate. Additionally, each demon who has been approved must sit through orientation on how to be a mortal. A real snooze fest, or so I hear. There’s even an hour-long talk on the importance of blinking.

However, I never knew they were that into performance. It feels like they’d rather be a magician in life, but I think they’d do better in a slasher film than on the streets of Vegas."
