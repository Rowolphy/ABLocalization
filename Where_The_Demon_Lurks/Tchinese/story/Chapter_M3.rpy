The exorcists have their own kind of magic which we haven't been able to understand what allowed their kind to tap into this power. Maybe they have an affinity to their soul unlike usual people?  Then there's the magic of angels and demons. I can't speak for Lucian and his kind but I know the demons are granted their powers upon creation to serve the Demon Lord. When it comes to Gary and I, well... it's difficult to say. I learnt how to cast portals from Paw, but everything else he told me I would discover it on my own. Even he didn't know how he came to the powers he had. I asked Gary before but the dude never even thought about where his powers came from. Just go with the flow he says."

Can’t trust them. That’s beside the fact that they are a mythical creature, but what kind? It just doesn’t make any sense. This snake may lead me to the bigger organisation, the Rings. I have to find out what their kind are planning."

The same can’t be said about his power, the ability to slow a person down if they ever have a shred of doubt. I can’t believe I used to have a staff member that terrifying... could there be others? I doubt anyone can get work done near that demon. I for one am always doubting one thing or another."
